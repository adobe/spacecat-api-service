    summary: Create a new import job
    description: |
      This endpoint can be used to start a new import job with a set of URLs, import API key,
      optional import.js mapping file, and optional custom headers. The import job will be processed 
      asynchronously and the status of the job can be queried at the /tools/import/jobs/{jobId} endpoint.
      If there is no import queue available at the time of the request, a 503 Service Unavailable response will
      be returned. A single import job per client is permitted, otherwise a 429 Too Many Requests
      response will be returned.
