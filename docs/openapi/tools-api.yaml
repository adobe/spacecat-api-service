    summary: Create a new import job
    description: |
      This endpoint starts a new import job with a set of URLs, an import API key, an optional import.js 
      mapping file, and optional custom headers. The job runs asynchronously, and its status can be 
      queried at /tools/import/jobs/{jobId}.
      
      If no import queue is available when the request is made, the endpoint returns a 503 Service 
      Unavailable response. Each client is allowed only one active import job; additional requests 
      will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response.
  
      An import job may include a type, specifying the kind of job to create. The available options 
      are 'doc' and 'xwalk', with 'doc' as the default if no type is provided.
