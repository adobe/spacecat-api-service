    deprecated: true
    description: |
      **Warning:** This API is deprecated, will be removed in future versions and should no longer be used or enhanced.
      Please use the Slack commands to trigger audits on-demand.
      
      This endpoint is useful for triggering an audit.
      The audit will be run asynchronously and the response will be returned immediately.

      The audit type is determined by the type parameter and must be one of the following:
        - 404
        - apex
        - cwv
        - lhs
        - lhs-desktop
        - lhs-mobile

      The URL can be either a site ID or a base URL depending on the audit type.
