/**
 * Recognises an upstream "already gone" response — the signal that an
 * idempotent DELETE-style operation can treat as success without falling
 * through to the generic 502 path.
 *
 * Strict shape: must be a SerenityTransportError AND status === 404.
 * Refuses to match generic Error subclasses or ad-hoc objects whose
 * `.status` happens to equal 404. This is the safe variant — a future
 * library or test stub decorating an unrelated error with `status: 404`
 * cannot silently turn into "upstream-idempotent-success" and swallow
 * a real failure.
 *
 * Used by every idempotent-DELETE site in the serenity surface:
 *   - markets.js handleDeleteMarket  (upstream project gone)
 *   - prompts.js handleUpdatePrompt  (deleted-then-create, the delete leg)
 *   - prompts.js handleBulkDeletePrompts  (per-project bucket delete)
